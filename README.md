# Training on parameters subspaces

This project purpose is to reproduce some of the results in [Measuring the
Intrinsic Dimension of Objective Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838)
and then:

  1. report on their main properties compared to standard smaller neural network
  2. test experimentally their performance for different subspace dimensions
  3. test experimentally their performance for different families of P

To see the resuts of the experiments look at the commented lines in `runs.sh`.
The data necessary for training will be downloaded automatically with the first
run and then read from the filesystem.

A more detailed description of the project is in `report.tex`.
